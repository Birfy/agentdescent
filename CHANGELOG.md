# Changelog

All notable changes to AgentDescent are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `tests` CI workflow — runs the offline suite on push/PR across Python 3.9 / 3.11 / 3.12.
- Test coverage for the async SGD path: `SgdSkillAggregator` keep/rollback,
  `eval_at_end`, batch-level propose, and the sync frontier gate.
- PyPI Trusted-Publishing workflow (`publish.yml`): OIDC release, no stored token.

### Fixed
- Bare `pytest` (fresh clone / CI) failed with `ModuleNotFoundError` because the
  repo root was not on `sys.path`; set `pythonpath = ["."]` in the pytest config.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-26

First public release on PyPI as **`agentdescent`**.

### Changed
- **Renamed the project Concordia → AgentDescent** — package `concordia/` →
  `agentdescent/`, classes `Concordia`/`AsyncConcordia` →
  `AgentDescent`/`AsyncAgentDescent`, and all docs, URLs, and branding.

### Added
- **EvoSkill**: batch-level failure-driven induction (one skill per batch, shared
  across workers), a sync per-candidate frontier (`TopKFrontierAggregator`) and an
  async SGD-style optimizer (`SgdSkillAggregator`: apply → validate every
  `val_every` steps → roll back on no held-out gain), plus an `eval_at_end` mode.
- Async engine: `self_verify` flag (skip the per-trajectory re-run for held-out-only
  ports) and a cold-start pending-intake throttle so the lag budget bounds
  un-merged work before the first commit.
- Faithful, offline-tested ports of ACE, GEPA, EvoSkill, SkillOpt, ADAS, and DGM,
  each loading its benchmark through the shared `agentdescent.dataloader`.
- The general `evolve()` / `async_evolve()` engine, git-backed `Ledger`, the
  discrete-space `Aggregator`, staleness policies, DP/TP/PP parallelism, layered
  governance, and the provider-agnostic `agentdescent.agents` completion layer.
